# Postmortem: When Gremlins Attacked Our Web Stack

## Issue Summary

**Duration:** 4 epic hours, from 14:00 to 18:00 UTC  
**Impact:** The user authentication service decided to take a nap, leaving our users stranded in the wild west of HTTP 500 errors. Roughly 30% of our active user base were left pondering life's mysteries instead of logging in.  
**Root Cause:** Blame it on the mischievous gremlins who tampered with our load balancer, disrupting the traffic flow to the authentication servers.

## Timeline

**Detection:** At the stroke of 14:00 UTC, our monitoring dashboard lit up like a disco ball with HTTP 500 errors.  
**Discovery:** Our engineers, armed with caffeinated drinks, received alerts faster than a superhero responding to a distress call. Users, meanwhile, flooded our support channels with creative error messages.

## Actions

1. Embarked on a quest through the enchanted application server logs, seeking clues to break the spell.
2. Attempted to reverse the gremlin mischief by rolling back code changes, hoping to find the right spellbook page.
3. Summoned the network wizards to inspect the load balancer for any signs of magical interference.

## Misleading Paths

- Thought the issue was a mere illusion in the application layer, a disappearing rabbit trick.
- Suspected a potential DDoS attack but realized it was just the mischievous gremlins playing tricks.

## Escalation

As local attempts failed, we blew the magic horn, summoning the infrastructure team and the network sorcerer for assistance.

## Resolution

After a fierce battle with the gremlins, we unveiled the misconfiguration in the load balancer. Turns out, it was leading the traffic on a scenic route, bypassing the authentication servers. Corrected the spell, and normalcy was restored at 18:00 UTC.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:** Gremlins messing with load balancer settings, disrupting the harmony of authentication requests.  
**Resolution:** Applied the anti-gremlin spell, correcting the load balancer settings. Initiated a review of our magical load balancing configuration process to prevent future magical mishaps.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

### Improvements/Fixes

- Enhanced our magical monitoring on load balancers to detect gremlin mischief promptly.
- Implemented automated testing of load balancer configurations, complete with an anti-gremlin charm.
- Established stricter change control procedures, including a mandatory gremlin detection spell for critical infrastructure components.

### Tasks

- Conducted a comprehensive review of load balancing configurations across all services, complete with a magic wand.
- Implemented automated testing scripts for load balancer configurations, ensuring they're gremlin-resistant.
- Enhanced documentation for load balancer changes, including a chapter on protecting against magical creatures.

## Conclusion

This magical adventure taught us the importance of being vigilant in the mystical realm of web stacks. Our corrective measures are like adding magical shields to our infrastructure, ensuring we're prepared for whatever fantastical challenges the digital universe throws at us next.
