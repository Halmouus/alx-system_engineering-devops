# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

## Issue Summary

**Duration:** 4 hours, from 14:00 to 18:00 UTC  
**Impact:** The user authentication service experienced complete downtime. Users attempting to log in encountered HTTP 500 errors, affecting approximately 30% of our active user base.  
**Root Cause:** A misconfiguration in the load balancer resulted in a failure to route traffic to the authentication servers.

## Timeline

**Detection:** The issue was first detected at 14:00 UTC when a spike in HTTP 500 errors was observed on the monitoring dashboard.  
**Discovery:** Engineers received automated alerts from our monitoring system highlighting the increased error rate. Simultaneously, user complaints flooded our support channels.

## Actions

1. Investigated the application server logs for potential errors or issues.
2. Assumed the problem might be related to recent code deployments and rolled back changes to the last known working version.
3. Engaged the network team to check for any unusual load balancer configurations.

## Misleading Paths

- Initially focused on the application layer, assuming a code regression or database connection issue.
- Assumed a potential DDoS attack due to the sudden spike in error rates.

## Escalation

After unsuccessful attempts to resolve the issue locally, escalated the incident to the infrastructure team and the network specialist.

## Resolution

Identified the misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, where it was not correctly distributing traffic to the authentication servers. The configuration was promptly corrected, and normal service was restored at 18:00 UTC.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:** The load balancer misconfiguration led to a breakdown in the traffic distribution mechanism, causing all authentication requests to fail.  
**Resolution:** The misconfigured load balancer settings were corrected. Additionally, a review of the load balancing configuration process was initiated to prevent similar issues in the future.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

### Improvements/Fixes

- Enhance monitoring on load balancers to detect misconfigurations promptly.
- Implement automated testing of load balancer configurations before deployment.
- Establish stricter change control procedures for critical infrastructure components.

### Tasks

- Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancing configurations across all services.
- Implement automated testing scripts for load balancer configurations.
- Enhance documentation for load balancer changes and review procedures.

## Conclusion

This incident highlighted the critical importance of robust monitoring and the need for rigorous testing of infrastructure changes. The corrective measures aim to fortify our system against similar issues in the future, emphasizing the significance of continuous improvement and learning from unexpected challenges.
